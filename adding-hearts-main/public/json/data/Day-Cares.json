      "The first years of a child's life are formative for the physical, emotional and intellectual development. Unfortunately, most underprivileged children in Ethiopia do not have the possibility to visit a kindergarten/preschool where they can develop these skills. The Day Care Centers in Addis Ababa and Debre Berhan provide the opportunity of preschool education and first school education. Children aged between 4 and 7 years from poorest families are being taken care of during daytime and do not spend their days alone at home or on the street. They can benefit from a daily structure which also includes a warm lunch."
