            "In response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and internal displacement due to political instability and natural disasters such as floods, KCCBSSA has actively participated in emergency support initiatives. Our goal is to assist those affected by these crises, particularly focusing on vulnerable women and children, including 20 persons with disabilities (PwD) in Showa Robit and Debre Birhan."

            "We plan to provide essential support, including food items, clothing, and household materials, to approximately 150 individuals in need. For instance, in 2021, KCCBSSA distributed 450 kilograms of wheat flour to 18 displaced individuals in Showa Robit, each receiving 25 kilograms. While our efforts to support persons with disabilities in Showa Robit are still in progress, we remain committed to coordinating with government agencies, including the Agency for Civil Society Organizations, to offer financial and material contributions to those in need. Through these initiatives, KCCBSSA aims to alleviate suffering and foster resilience in affected communities."
