            "KCCBSSA's Vocational Training Services are designed to empower youth who have either dropped out of school or completed grade 10 and beyond, particularly those who may not have the opportunity to pursue further education. Recognizing that these individuals often face significant barriers to employment due to economic challenges and a lack of skills, our program aims to equip them with practical vocational skills that enhance their employability."

            "Since 2010, we have offered training in key areas such as Food Preparation, Basic Computer Skills, and Women’s Beauty Salon services. While the Food Preparation training has been temporarily suspended since 2014 due to insufficient enrollment and funding, our other programs have thrived. To date, we have successfully graduated 719 individuals in Basic Computer Training (comprising 253 males and 466 females) and 535 individuals in Women’s Beauty Salon training (with 47 males and 488 females).",
            "Through these vocational training initiatives, we aim to provide participants with the skills necessary to secure meaningful employment and improve their quality of life, ultimately contributing to the economic development of their communities."
