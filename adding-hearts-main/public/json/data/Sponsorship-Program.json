            "KCCBSSA's Sponsorship Program is designed to provide essential support to children from disadvantaged backgrounds, ensuring they have access to education and resources necessary for their development. This program offers two key forms of assistance: annual provision of school materials and monthly financial aid. To date, we have successfully supplied school materials and uniforms to over 10,000 children in our project areas."

            "The monthly financial assistance is specifically aimed at helping families cover educational costs and basic living expenses, enabling children to continue their schooling without interruption. Currently, we support 150 students, a number that has unfortunately decreased from 600 due to funding constraints. Our sponsorship initiatives are primarily funded through generous contributions from various donors, with Pro Kind Switzerland being a significant partner. Through this program, we are committed to transforming the lives of vulnerable children and their families, fostering a brighter future for all."
