      "The monthly financial assistance is specifically aimed at helping families cover educational costs and basic living expenses, enabling children to continue their schooling without interruption. Currently, we support 150 students, a number that has unfortunately decreased from 600 due to funding constraints. Our sponsorship initiatives are primarily funded through generous contributions from various donors, with Pro Kind Switzerland being a significant partner. Through this program, we are committed to transforming the lives of vulnerable children and their families, fostering a brighter future for all."
